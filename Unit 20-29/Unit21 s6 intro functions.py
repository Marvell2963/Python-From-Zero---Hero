# Introduction to Functions
    # Creating clean repeatable code is a key part of effective programmer.
    # Functions = it is a program of a bunch of blocks of code that can be executed many times, without rewrite entire block of code.
    # IMPORTANT: try to practice combining everthing you have learned so far (control flow, loops, etc.) with functions to become an effective programmer.
    

    # Rules about learning about functions of Python:
        # Be patient with yourself 
        # take your time to practice the material.
        # start your time to practice the material.
        # start getting exited about your new skills and start sthinking about personal projects.
